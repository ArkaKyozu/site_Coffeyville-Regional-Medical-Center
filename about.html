                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Regional Medical Center (CRMC)</strong> is a 501(c)3 municipal, non-profit hospital licensed for 47 beds. On an annual basis, we serve over 45,000 patients from Montgomery, Chautauqua, Labette, Allen, Neosho and Wilson counties in Kansas, as well as Nowata and Craig counties in Oklahoma. Established in 1949, CRMC has grown over the years and expanded its facilities and technology to stay current with today’s world. Our mission is to serve our patients and families with the highest quality healthcare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a rural hospital, CRMC is surprising because of its large size and wide variety of services. Although we can provide many of the same services you will find in a big city, we take great pride in our friendly and caring staff. Our physicians have lived, worked and been involved in our community for many years. Some have been here 30-plus years; they know you, not only as a patient, but as a friend and neighbor.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Whether you are a patient, family member or visitor, we want you to feel like part of our family when you come through our doors. Any hospital can provide nursing care, but we believe that we go beyond, providing great care with a “tender loving” touch . If you haven’t visited CRMC in a while, please choose us, your neighbor, the next time you need hospital services. Come and feel the difference.
                </p>
